# PSA

The `zotero` package is now **Zotero 7**. If you want Zotero 6, install the `zotero6` package. These can be installed side-by-side, even if you can only have one of them running at any given time.

# Primary source:

<!-- * packages: https://zotero.retorque.re/file/apt-package-archive/index.html -->
* https://zotero.retorque.re/file/apt-package-archive

(re)install using
```
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/retorquere/zotero-deb/master/install.sh | sudo bash
```

**Mirrors:**

----

This repository contains packaged releases of [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org) and [Juris-M](https://juris-m.github.io) for Debian-based Linux systems and Crostini-enabled chromebooks, and the script used to build them. It also offers the latest nightly zotero-beta.

This repository updates to new releases of Zotero and Juris-M within 2 hours, usually faster.

## Contents of the packages

The packages include the whole Zotero/Juris-M binaries, as built by Zotero / Juris-M teams themselves.

The packages provide a system-wide installation (into the `/usr/lib` directory), as opposed to a single-user installation (e.g. in your `HOME` directory).

They manage both desktop file registration and MimeType registration.

## Installing Zotero / Juris-M

If you're previously used the tarball install, delete `~/.local/share/applications/zotero.desktop`.

### Installing Zotero

To install Zotero, use the following commands:

```
wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/retorquere/zotero-deb/master/install.sh | sudo bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install zotero
```

### Installing Juris-M

To install Juris-M, use the following commands:

```
wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/retorquere/zotero-deb/master/install.sh | sudo bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install jurism
```

**Note**

You can use `curl` instead of `wget` by typing
```
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/retorquere/zotero-deb/master/install.sh | sudo bash
```

## Updating Zotero / Juris-M

The Zotero / Juris-M programs provided by this repository have their self-update facility disabled.

Simply rely on on your system's package manager to give you update notifications when a new version comes out.

Alternatively, you can use the following commands:

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
```

install.sh will ask for sudo permissions to install the pointer to the apt repo, and to add the signing key to the keyring.

## Beta packages

This repo also has the nightly beta's, installable as the `zotero-beta` and `jurism-beta` packages. You can install these alongside the regular packages.

## Package signing errors in Debian/Ubuntu/...

The accepted key format in Debian-based systems seems to have changed a while ago, which means the existing signing verification key you have may no longer be available during install. Re-running the install script will remedy that:

```
wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/retorquere/zotero-deb/master/install.sh | sudo bash
```

## Instructions for installation using the new deb822 repo pointer format

add the `-8` flag to the install script to install the new deb822 repo pointer format:

```
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/retorquere/zotero-deb/master/install.sh | sudo bash -s -- -8
```

## Instructions for installation on Crostini-capable Chromebooks

Instructions for installation on Crostini-capable Chromebooks can be found on the [wiki](https://github.com/retorquere/zotero-deb/wiki).

## Uninstall

```
wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/retorquere/zotero-deb/master/uninstall.sh | sudo bash
sudo apt-get purge zotero
```

## What goes on under the hood in `install.sh`

The install.sh is convenient, but there's a risk to running random scripts from the internet as root. What the script does, and what you could manually do yourself, is:

Check whether you are installing on a supported architecture:

```
case `uname -m` in
  "i386" | "i686" | "x86_64")
    ;;
  *)
    echo "Zotero is only available for architectures i686 and x86_64"
    exit
    ;;
esac
```

Set up some basic information about the repo and your environment:

```
KEYNAME=zotero-archive-keyring.gpg
GPGKEY=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/retorquere/zotero-deb/master/$KEYNAME
KEYRING=/usr/share/keyrings/$KEYNAME
```

checks whether you have `curl` or `wget` and use that to download the public key for signature verification

```
if [ -x "$(command -v curl)" ]; then
  sudo curl -L $GPGKEY -o $KEYRING
elif [ -x "$(command -v wget)" ]; then
  sudo wget -O $KEYRING $GPGKEY
else
  echo "Error: need wget or curl installed." >&2
  exit 1
fi
sudo chmod 644 $KEYRING
```

remove old key with too broad reach if present

```
sudo rm -f /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/zotero.gpg
```

install repo pointer

```
cat << EOF | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/zotero.list
deb [signed-by=$KEYRING by-hash=force] https://zotero.retorque.re/file/apt-package-archive ./
EOF
```

clean up remnants from previous use of another mirror, if any

```
sudo apt-get clean
```
